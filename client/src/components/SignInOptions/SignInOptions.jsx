/* NEW: this component will show the sign in with Google button as well as option to sign in with email and password
**
** NEW: there will need to be a link to a registration page which says "Don't have an account? Register here"
**
** this component will be rendered in a <Modal /> component which is triggered from the sign in button in the header. 
** 
** This button currently signs the user in via Google - we will need to create a separate <SignInWithGoogle /> 
** component to handle this
